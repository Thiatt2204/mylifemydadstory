  <h1>My Life My Dad Story – The Path To Financial Freedom</h1>

  <p>
    My name is Tom — husband, dad… and guess what? I missed both my children’s firsts: their first words, first steps, their first day at nursery, even sports days — all because I was out working to provide the best life possible. 
    Does this resonate with you? <strong>KEEP reading.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    For years, I traded time for money thinking it was the only way to provide. I worked 16-hour days on average — sometimes leaving at 3am and returning home by 10pm. I didn’t see my children awake during the week. Once, I even worked 37 hours straight. And for what? A better life for my family?
  </p>

  <p>
    As time passed, I realised you <strong>can’t put a price on missed memories</strong>. My kids are now 7 and 8, and the penny finally dropped: <em>something needed to change</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    That’s when I discovered <strong>Launch You</strong>. I saw a video by a guy named Dan — no pushy sales pitch, no “get rich quick” nonsense. Just a fellow dad wanting more time with his family and his hobbies. I thought, "That’s ME."
  </p>

  <p>
    I clicked. Then came Stuart’s video — and it changed everything. He explained that making money online isn’t magic — it’s method. He shared a proven blueprint that’s helped everyday people like me… like Dan… and maybe even like <strong>you</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was skeptical. Another online course? Another “promise”? But this felt different. It wasn’t about hype — it was about hope. About real steps. Real people. A real path forward.
  </p>

  <p>
    Yes, I hesitated when I saw the price — especially as a UK dad looking at dollar signs — but I took a leap. And I’m <strong>so glad I did</strong>. Because this isn’t just a course… it’s a complete roadmap.
  </p>

  <p>
    With <strong>Launch You</strong>, I’ve found a course with tools, resources, and a real <strong>community</strong>. I asked questions — and real people answered. The Facebook groups? Full of parents like us. Different stages, same mission: time + freedom.
  </p>

  <p>
    I used to be an engineer. I’m now a project coordinator. And now — I’m building something bigger. A life with presence. With possibility.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you’re tired of making someone else rich while missing out on your kids’ lives… If you’re ready to become part of the 1% who <em>own their time</em>… <strong>This is your sign.</strong>
